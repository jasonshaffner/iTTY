iTTY
====

A small suite of tools designed to simplify network maintenance and administration.

The base module, iTTY.py, was created to provide a template to log in and run commands on multiple OS.

This has been tested to work with Cisco IOS-XR, Cisco IOS, Cisco ASA, Juniper JUNOS, and Alcatel TiMOS.

*SSH functionality is dependent on paramiko (https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko).

There are a number of scripts based on the module in development. Check the _scripts_ folder and documentation for more details.
